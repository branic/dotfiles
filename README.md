# dotfiles

dotfiles that I use.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.


## Inspiration

Inspiration for the contents of these dotfiles comes from many sources, many of which by now are long forgotten.
The repo structure and implementation used here was influenced by https://github.com/benmatselby/dotfiles among
other sites.

For lots of examples of dotfiles see https://dotfiles.github.io/inspiration/
