## Inspiration

Inspiration for the contents of these dotfiles comes from many sources, many of which by now are long forgotten.

- <https://github.com/benmatselby/dotfiles>
- <https://github.com/statico/dotfiles>
- various other repos, blogs, and google searches that I've accumulated over the years.
